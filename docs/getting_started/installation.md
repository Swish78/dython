of the following methods:

* Install source code using pip: 
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/shakedzy/dython.git`
```
* Download the source code as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/shakedzy/dython/zipball/master)
* Download the source code as a [TAR ball](https://github.com/shakedzy/dython/tarball/master)
